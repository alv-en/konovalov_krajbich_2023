files base for my masters capstone project: replication study for Konovalov and Krajbich (2023), [Decision Times Reveal Private Information in Strategic Settings: Evidence from Bargaining Experiments](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3023640)

## Abstract of replication paper
In the 2023 article Decision Times Reveal Private Information in Strategic Settings: Evidence from Bargaining Experiments by Konovalov & Krajbich (2023), researchers examine how people's response times in two-stage bargaining experiments can reveal their preferences (Konovalov & Krajbich, 2023). The study finds that faster rejections by buyers correspond to smaller foregone surpluses, enabling sellers to infer buyers' values from response times. This creates an incentive for buyers to manipulate their response times strategically. The study identifies conditions where subjects exhibit and do not exhibit such strategic behavior, providing initial insights into the use of response time as a strategic variable. This replication reproduces the results and concurs with the original results in terms of the original laboratory data, while reexamining the theoretical and empirical robustness.

## other notes
I couldn't retrace where I found the replication package originally so I'm just including the zip file here. In other words, I am not the author of all of the code here.
